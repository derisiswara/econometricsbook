The book was written by Muhammad Firdaus, Tony Irawan, Fahmi Salam Ahmad, Hermanto Siregar, Deri Siswara, and Rodi Jakariya. You can order the full version [here](https://bit.ly/buku-jurnal-rstudio2), which includes more detailed explanations.

This book aims to help students and researchers apply econometric models in analysis using RStudio software. It begins with an introduction to the use of R programming language and RStudio as an IDE. The book covers topics on theory and application of OLS models, including testing Gauss-Markov conditions. Additionally, it presents the application of time-series models such as ARMA, GARCH, VAR, VECM, ARDL, SVAR., static and dynamic panel data analysis using RStudio's instruments that accommodate heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation assumptions. Finally, there is a discussion of spatial model applications for analysis with spatial or regional elements. In this latest publication update includes three additional chapters: spillover analysis on time series data; DCC-GARCH; Non-linear ARDL. Updates will be made frequently.
